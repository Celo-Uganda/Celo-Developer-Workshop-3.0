#### Project Description:

Edufy is an innovative education platform designed to bridge the gap between instructors and learners. Our platform addresses the challenges in education by empowering instructors to create and sell their own courses while enabling users to easily purchase and access these courses. The platform also aims to enhance the learning experience by incorporating video classes, challenging tests, course reviews, and the option for users to earn NFTs upon course completion.

**The Value of Our Approach:**

**`Empowering Instructors`**: Edufy gives instructors the autonomy to design and sell courses according to their expertise and knowledge. By providing this platform, we encourage educators to share their knowledge with a global audience and generate income from their courses.

**`Seamless Learning Experience`**: Learners can access a diverse range of courses from instructors worldwide. The inclusion of video classes and challenging tests ensures a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.

**`Community and Feedback`**: The course review feature allows learners to provide feedback, enabling instructors to improve their courses continually. This fosters a sense of community and collaboration within the platform.

**`NFT Incentive`**: By awarding NFTs to users upon course completion, Edufy offers a unique incentive that adds value to the learning journey. NFTs can be a tangible recognition of a user's achievements and milestones.

#### Intended Users:

Our platform caters to two main user groups:

**Instructors**: Educators, experts, and professionals who wish to create and sell courses to a wide audience. They can leverage Edufy to share their knowledge and monetize their expertise.

**Learners**: Students, professionals, and anyone with a thirst for knowledge can join Edufy to explore a diverse catalog of courses, learn new skills, and enhance their personal and professional growth.

#### Summary:

Edufy empowers instructors to create and sell courses while offering learners a seamless and engaging learning experience. The implemented features include:

1. `Course Creation`: Instructors can create and list their courses on the platform, setting their own prices.
2. `Course selling`: Instructors directly sell their list  courses just after the course creation.
3. `Course Purchase`: Users can browse the catalog and purchase courses they are interested in.

##### Features for Future Implementation:

1. `Video Classes and Tests`: Courses include video classes and challenging tests to enhance the learning process.

2. `Course Review`: Learners can provide feedback and ratings for courses they have completed.

3. `NFT Incentive`: Upon course completion, users are rewarded with an NFT as a token of achievement.
