### QUICK START GUIDES

View the [Developer Code Examples page](https://docs.celo.org/developer#quickstart) to get started using the Celo SDKs with guided coding exercises.

### Tutorials
- [Tutorial - Celo Developer Blog](https://docs.celo.org/blog)

### TOOLS

#### Boilerplates
- [celo-composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer#celo-composer)
	- Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

#### SDKs

-   [ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer/contractkit#what-is-contractkit)
	-   Javascript package of Celo blockchain utilities
	-   Manage connections to the Celo blockchain, accounts, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, etc.
	-   A set of wrappers around the core protocol smart contracts to easily connect with contracts related to governance, validators, on-chain exchange, etc.
	-   Includes [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/)
-   [Celo Ethers.js Wrapper](https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper) (experimental)
	-   A minimal wrapper to make [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) compatible with the Celo network
-   [use-react](https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo)
	- The easiest way to access Celo in your React applications ðŸ”¥. react-celo is a React hook for managing access to Celo with a built-in headless modal system for connecting to your users wallet of choice.
	- Now your DApp can be made available to everyone in the Celo ecosystem, from Valora users to self custodied Ledger users.
	- By default react-celo is styled so that you can drop it into your application and go, however it's fully customisable so you can maintain a consistent UX throughout your application.
-   [DappKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/dappkit)
	-   Easily connect to the [Valora](http://valoraapp.com/) wallet with your React Native mobile application
	-   Valora manages user account, private keys and transaction signing, so you can focus on building your dapp
